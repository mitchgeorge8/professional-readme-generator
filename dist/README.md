# Professional README Generator

## Description

README files can be tricky to make, especially if you want them to be consistent. This application will create one for you.

I built this project to help myself, and others, create clean and consistent README files.

It solves the problem of inconsistent or incomplete README files.

I learned a lot about Node.js and the Inquirer package. I also learned about JavaScript Promises and how they can be very helpful.
